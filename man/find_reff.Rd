\title{Find the effective radius of a simulated galaxy.}
\usage{
find_reff(filename, ptype = NA, r200, inc_deg, axis_ratio)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{The Gadget file containing the particle information of the galaxy to be analysed.}

\item{ptype}{The particle type/types to be extracted - NA (default) gives all particles in the simulation, 1 - gas, 2 - dark matter, 3 - disc, 4 - bulge, 5 - stars, 6 - boundary.}

\item{r200}{The virial radius specified in the simulation, kpc.}

\item{inc_deg}{The observed inclination of the simulated galaxy in degrees.}

\item{axis_ratio}{A data frame containing the semi-major and semi-minor axes lengths for the observed galaxy, as given by ifu_cube() or blur_cube().}
}
\value{
Returned is a scaled axis ratio that describes the semimajor and semiminor axes of an ellipse that contains half the total number of particles.
}
\description{
The purpose of this function is to find the observed effective radius of a simulated galaxy projected at a user supplied inclination. It works
by ordering particles by their observed radius and returning the radial coordinate at which half the total number of particles in the galaxy is contained.
